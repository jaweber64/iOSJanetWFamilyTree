            <h2>FAMILY</h2>
            <h4>The Weber Adventure - A Brief History</h4>
            <p>
            Mark and Janet met while at Valparaiso University and eventually began dating.
            After graduation, they both took their first jobs out of college with Unisys near
            Philadelphia, PA.  Mark finally popped the question (at Valley Forge National Park
            on a freezing December night)!   We moved back to IL to be near family.  Mark
            worked for Pandex which eventually became Baxter.  Janet worked for Fermilab and
            coached gymnastics.  We bought our first house, and got married in 1990.
            Then came the kids!

                Christian, Joseph, Aaron, Hannah (move to bigger house), Nathaniel
                and Luke!  After Joseph, Janet stayed home full time.  Preschool,
                elementary school - eventually home school, Sunday school, soccer,
                swimming, baseball, one season of football, summer bible camp, soccer
                refereeing, highschool, lifeguarding, swim coaching, college and more!
                Now, the oldest is "off the Weber payroll" and is out on his own.  The
                next three are in college and the younger two are in highschool.  Somewhere
                in there we moved to our current home in Cary and Mark's career took him to
                Nanosphere, Inc. then to Fenwal, and finally to Fresenius Kabi.

                    The empty nest is just around the corner - yikes!  Janet is taking some
                    coursework at the local community college, getting ready to find employment
                    or start a business.  Mark recently bought a fishing kayak and is spending
                    more time on the water.  We both spend time on Zillow dreaming about a retirement 
                    that includes a lake house.

                    And that's about it.  All are doing well.  Life is very fulfilling and crazy busy!!
